# German Credit Risk Prediction

This project implements an **interactive credit risk prediction app** using **machine learning techniques** on a large German credit dataset.  

## Project Overview
- Performed **feature engineering** and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Trained and tuned multiple **machine learning models** using **scikit-learn** and **xgboost**, selecting optimal hyperparameters to maximize predictive accuracy.
- Evaluated model performance to ensure **robustness and reliability** of predictions.
- Deployed an **interactive web application** to visualize predictions and explore credit risk scenarios dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3** for data processing and app development
- **NumPy** & **Pandas** for numerical computations and dataset handling
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation
- **Streamlit** for interactive web app deployment

## App Access
The app is deployed online
